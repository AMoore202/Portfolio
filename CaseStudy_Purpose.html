			<h2>CONTEXT:</h2>
			<p>The national health care sector in Canada is inherently complex. Given that health care delivery is provincial jurisdiction, national health is primarily focused on higher level goals, namely transforming how health is conceived and executed across the country. In addition to Health Canada, this transformation is the responsibility of a handful of non-profit organizations called Pan-Canadian Health Organizations (PCHOs). Although each PCHO has a unique mandate, there are also large areas of overlap. In order to do it's best work, it is crucial that PCHOs continuously refine their core purpose and identify where they can make this biggest. As part of a strategic planning process, my team's job was to facilitate a PCHO in updating their purpose.</p>

			<h3>National Surveys</h3>
			<p>Before we undertook the task of collaboratively defining our client's purpose, we needed to get a holistic view of the sector. Using a national survey, the client was able to gather a large swath of quantitative and qualitative data. The focus on this data was to assess Canadian's perspective on the health care landscape broadly and where they saw gaps that our client would be well positioned to fill. </p>

			<p>In addition to getting a breadth of data from the surveys, we also wanted to tap into the deep knowledge of the thought leaders throughout the sector. To dig into this wealth of knowledge, my team and I conducted in-depth interviews. Framed by the knowledge accrued through our surveys, I was able to ask questions</p>

			<p>With insight and direction from the Board, we had our creative license to draft a purpose statement. A small working group, consisting of senior leadership and board members, was formed to pen to paper and create a pithy clause to guide the organization. In designing the approach for this team's working sessions, I wanted to balance the need for creativity and new ideas with the </p>

			<h3>Comms Drafting</h3>
			<p>After we had laid out our hypotheses, our next step was to determine the questions we were going to ask in our interviews. Given that we were using a semi-structured interview format, it was important that we had a short list of questions and didnâ€™t overprescribe the flow of the conversation.</p>
