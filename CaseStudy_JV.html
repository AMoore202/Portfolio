			<h2>CONTEXT:</h2>
			<p>In the world of major infrastructure projects - think bridges, highways - complex partnerships devised to complete projects. Groups of engineers, architects, and construction workers come together from different companies to make their contribution to the project. The dynamics of these impromptu teams have major effects on the success of the project and can ultimately save, or cost, investers billions of dollars. The key question of this research initiative was to understand the key ingredients that lead to a strong and purposeful team dynamic for these major infrastructure projects.</p>

			<h3>Hypothesis Development</h3>
			<p>Going into this project, we were not starting from square one. My team already had frameworks for evaluating teams in our back pocket and we wanted to use this knowledge to inform our approach. On the other hand, we also didn’t want our previous experience to overly bias the questions we were asking. To account for this, I started off with a hypothesis development session.</p>
			<strong><p style="font-family: latoSemiBold">In this session, we identified three things:</p></strong>
			<div style="padding-left: 80px;padding-right: 80px">
				<ol>
					<li>The key ingredients that we hypothesized, a priori, would lead to a successful joint venture.</li>
					<li>What evidence would appear if this hypothesis was true.</li>
					<li>What evidence would appear if this hypothesis was false.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="approachSubHolderImage1"></div>
		<div class="approachSubHolderBody2">
			<h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">Question Ideation</h3>
			<p>After we had laid out our hypotheses, our next step was to determine the questions we were going to ask in our interviews. Given that we were using a semi-structured interview format, it was important that we had a short list of questions and didn’t overprescribe the flow of the conversation. In this facilitated session, we started by mapping out all of the areas the we wanted to cover in our interviews and ideated potential questions for each area. Although painful, we then made our way down the list, selecting best questions. In particular, we selected questions that would allow the participants to tell stories and would us provide with rich data to analyze.</p>

			<h3>Semi-Structured Interviews</h3>
			<p>Once we had done our prep work, we were ready for the interviews. In addition to the logistics work of wrangling the schedules of fifty or so executives, my primary role in these interviews was data capture. To ensure consistent encoding of responses, I created a structured note taking form in the form of a survey, which has two benefits:</p>
			<div style="padding-left: 80px;padding-right: 80px">
				<ol>
					<li>As opposed multiple pages of notes saved throughout the company file share, using a survey allows for a centralized and singular source of data; and</li>
					<li>Exporting the data as a table, with the interview questions as columns and the rows as participants, makes the data much easier to manage, allowing for quick filtering and the creation of cross-tabs.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

		<div class="approachSubHolderImage3"></div>
		<div class="approachSubHolderBody4">
			<h3 style="padding-top: 60px;">Theme Mapping</h3>
			<p>Our interviews resulted in rich and complex data with intertwined narratives. To get a better grasp on this data, my analysis approach started with theme mapping. I begun by roughly tagging quotes from our interviews into general categories. Once I had this tagging, I continued by clustering these categories and mapping out how they connected with one another. Using a mind-map structure, I was able to see how our themes connected with one another and ultimately build a set of concise insights.</p>

		<div class="approachSubHolderBody5">
			<h3  style="padding-top: 17px;">Cluster Development and Validation</h3>
			<p>Infrastructure companies are far from uniform; they vary vastly in size, speciality, and organizational culture. As part of our analysis we wanted to predict what companies would be effective partners for our client. In our interviews, we collected a measure of perceived partnership success in past projects. Using this as the dependent variable, I began building a model using K-Means clustering. This model was built using a combination of real predictors, such as the size of the company, and dummy coded variables created from the qualitative analysis. Through this model we were able to develop three clusters of potential partners and to identify which of these clusters would be best to partner with in the future.</p>

			<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">Tiered Reporting</h3>
			<p>Although the primary audience for this initiative was our client's senior management team, we also wanted the insights developed from our research to reach a broader audience. However, given the strategic value of some insights, not all could be widely shared. To account for this I develop a tiered reporting scheme, in which multiple versions of the report were shared with different audiences. In addition to customizing the content of these reports, the structure and format of the report was also tailored to each audience in order to best fit their needs. For example, our report to our client's senior management team was an in-depth presentation, rich with contextual details and recommendations. Conversely, the report we distributed to our participants, was a stand-along document focusing on the big insights.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Through this research initiative we were able to gain a deep understanding of what had led to success in past partnerships and extrapolate how to create similar successes in the future. Furthermore, through our cluster analysis we were able to identify organizations that would be well set up to work partner with our client, ultimately leading the client to develop a comprehensive partnership strategy. Finally, through our tiered reporting to the interview participants we were able to build sector-wide knowledge on partnership strategies and further solidify our client's reputation as leading partner in the sector.</p>
