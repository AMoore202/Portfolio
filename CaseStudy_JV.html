		<h2>CONTEXT:</h2>
		<p>In the world of major infrastructure projects - think bridges, highways - complex partnerships devised to complete projects. Groups of engineers, architects, and construction workers come together from different companies to make their contribution to the project. The dynamics of these impromptu teams have major effects on the success of the project and can ultimately save, or cost, investers billions of dollars. The key question of this research initiative was to understand the key ingredients that lead to a strong and purposeful team dynamic for these major infrastructure projects.</p>

		<h3>Hypothesis Development</h3>
		<p>Going into this project, we were not starting from square one. My team already had frameworks for evaluating teams in our back pocket and we wanted to use this knowledge to inform our approach. On the other hand, we also didn’t want our previous experience to overly bias the questions we were asking. To account for this, I started off with a hypothesis development session.</p>
		<strong><p style="font-family: latoSemiBold">In this session, we identified three things:</p></strong>
		<div style="padding-left: 80px;padding-right: 80px">
			<ol>
				<li>The key ingredients that we hypothesized, a priori, would lead to a successful joint venture.</li>
				<li>What evidence would appear if this hypothesis was true.</li>
				<li>What evidence would appear if this hypothesis was false.</li>

		<h3>Question Ideation</h3>
		<p>After we had laid out our hypotheses, our next step was to determine the questions we were going to ask in our interviews. Given that we were using a semi-structured interview format, it was important that we had a short list of questions and didn’t overprescribe the flow of the conversation. In this facilitated session, we started by mapping out all of the areas the we wanted to cover in our interviews and ideated potential questions for each area. Although</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Through this research initiative we were able to gain a deep understanding of what had led to success in past partnerships and extrapolate how to create similar successes in the future. Furthermore, through our cluster analysis we were able to identify organizations that would be well set up to work partner with our client, ultimately leading the client to develop a comprehensive partnership strategy. Finally, through our tiered reporting to the interview participants we were able to build sector-wide knowledge on partnership strategies and further solidify our client's reputation as leading partner in the sector.</p>
