		<h2>CONTEXT:</h2>
		<p>In the world of major infrastructure projects - think bridges, highways - complex partnerships devised to complete projects. Groups of engineers, architects, and construction workers come together from different companies to make their contribution to the project. The dynamics of these impromptu teams have major effects on the success of the project and can ultimately save, or cost, investers billions of dollars. The key question of this research initiative was to understand the key ingredients that lead to a strong and purposeful team dynamic for these major infrastructure projects.</p>

		<h3>Hypothesis Development</h3>
		<p>Going into this project, we were not starting from square one. My team already had frameworks for evaluating teams in our back pocket and we wanted to use this knowledge to inform our approach. On the other hand, we also didn’t want our previous experience to overly bias the questions we were asking. To account for this, I started off with a hypothesis development session.</p>
		<strong><p style="font-family: latoSemiBold">In this session, we identified three things:</p></strong>
		<div style="padding-left: 80px;padding-right: 80px">
			<ol>
				<li>The key ingredients that we hypothesized, a priori, would lead to a successful joint venture.</li>
				<li>What evidence would appear if this hypothesis was true.</li>
				<li>What evidence would appear if this hypothesis was false.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="approachSubHolderImage1"></div>
	<div class="approachSubHolderBody2">
		<h3>Question Ideation</h3>
		<p>After we had laid out our hypotheses, our next step was to determine the questions we were going to ask in our interviews. Given that we were using a semi-structured interview format, it was important that we had a short list of questions and didn’t overprescribe the flow of the conversation. </p>
